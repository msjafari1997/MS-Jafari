# Safe-RL
Safe Reinforcement Learning via Curriculum Induction

This file contains a simple implementation of a grid-world "key and door" problem and CMDP approximate solutions using a proxy Q-Learning.
This is not the whole implementation of CISR. In this work, multiple intervention sets are designed and tested to see how they affect the results.
Also, an approximately optimal solution (mixed interventions) is considered to see if CISR works after optimization.
A simulation of GP-UCB algorithm is also added.
